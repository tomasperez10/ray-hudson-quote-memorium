# JavaScript/Rails Portfolio Project: Ray Hudson Quote Memorium

## About

Welcome to my Javascript/Rails portfolio project! In this repository, you will find an app built with a Rails API for the backend, and a JavaScript frontend. This application directs you to a website in which you can login with a username and see the website's picks for Ray Hudson's top 5 quotes. Each quote has an included behavior when clicked on, where it redirects you to its associated video.
